# Simon-Game

Simon's game is powered by JavaScript and jQuery. This game was a challenge created by Dr. Yu at "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp", as a test of the learned knowledge. She served as a guide all along the path, providing hints for the successful realisation of the game.

Throughout the script there are comments which indicate what the code is doing at any given moment.
